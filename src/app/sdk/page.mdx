# Why do I need an SDK?

You may often want to integrate [Rebill](https://rebill.com/)'s payment solution directly into your website. This approach keeps your customers on your domain throughout their transaction process, ensuring a consistent and branded experience.

Let's be reaaaaaaaaal - sending customersssss to a random payment page is like kicking them out of your party just when they're ready to buy drinks! üé≠ Our SDK is your magical lasso that keeps shoppers hypnotized on your site while they gladly empty their digital wallets. Sleek as a sports car, seamless as butter on hot toast, and let's just say it... sexier than your ex's Instagram. Your checkout just leveled up from "meh" to "TAKE MY MONEY!"

Oh, and about that snoozeeeeee-worthyyyyyy security stuff? üõ°Ô∏è We're the paranoid bodyguards so you don't have to be! Our integration is PCI DSS compliant (translation: we've built Fort Knox around your customers' credit cards while wearing extremely serious faces). While other payment solutions are leaving doors unlocked, we're installing laser beams, guard dogs, AND changing the secret password daily. You focus on your money dance üíÉüí∞ while we obsessively triple-check that no digital pickpockets are lurking nearby. Sweet financial dreams are made of this!

## Our solution

Rebill's SDK is a purely JavaScript-based solution that manages transactions and facilitates card tokenization for existing clients. This approach makes integrating with your app effortless: Simply insert a script tag into your HTML.

  ```html
  <script src="https://sdk.rebill.com/v3/rebill.js"></script>
  ```

## **Rebill Components**

Our SDK Checkout is composed of Rebill Components. Each component is a component-based UI solution that allows you to integrate the 100+ payment methods available easily. This feature is called **Rebill Components** and allows you to embed an iframe, delegating the full responsibility of transaction management to the provided UI.

By default, this approach renders a prebuilt checkout page to start accepting online payments, which is fully customizable ([see customization](https://docs.rebill.com/sdk/checkout#display)).
