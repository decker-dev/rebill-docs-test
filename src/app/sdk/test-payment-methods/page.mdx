# Test Payment Methods

Use the corresponding payment method for the country and currency you wish to try out. Simulate payments to test your integration. {{ className: 'lead' }}

PayPal is a widely used payment method that allows users to make payments using their PayPal balance, bank account. To test PayPal payments in sandbox mode, follow these steps:

To make sure your integrations works correctly, simulate transactions without moving real money with the values listed below. Test cards let you simulate several scenarios, depending on the country and the result you wish to be returned by the transaction request.

You can test payments through our no-code, highly customizable [Checkout Landing](https://docs.rebill.com/products/checkout-landing). For doing this, you'll first need to have at least one [Product](https://docs.rebill.com/guides/products) and created. You can also test payments directly through API calls.
